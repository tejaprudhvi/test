* To work in Linux server we will use some pre-requisite softwares.
-->SSH tools (Secure Shell)
1)Putty
2)Super putty
Note: if we are using windows it is necessary to install either one of these SSH tools. 
      it is not necessary when we use MacBook. because there will be a in-built SSH tool called "Terminal" in MacBook.
* By using these SSH tools we can connect to any remote server(even if it is in USA). for that we need IP Address/Host name,
User id and Password of server which we want to connect.
* And also we can execute commands, install softwares, create folders after connecting to the server by using these SSH Tools.
-->FTP Tools (File Transfer Protocal)
1)WinSCP(Windows Secure copy)-only works in Windows OS.
2)FileZilla-works in any OS.
* if we want to upload files into the server or to download files from the server these FTP tools are useful.

Introduction To Linux:-
-----------------------
*Linux Started around 1991 by Linus Torlvads.
*it is multi user OS. N number of users can access this Linux OS at a time..
*it is also Multi tasking OS. N number of tasks can perform in this Linux OS at a time..
*Linux is Open Source. means we can see the source code of OS and also we can customize that Source code.
*Linux is Case sensitive. we should enter commands in lower case letters.
*Linux has some distributions(flavours). 1)Redhat 2)CentOS 3)Ubuntu. etc.,

Linux File Structure:-
----------------------
*In linux we are having directories as folders in windows.
*In Linux, / is the root directory or Parent directory.
*this root directory is having some sub directories... eg. Home(Users), bin(binary files)- in linux each command is having
a binary file. for eg. ls, mkdir, cd etc., sbin(system bin)- it also contains binary files. for eg. useradd, userdel, shut
down etc.,

different types of users in Linux.
* Admin/root/super user
* Normal Users-these normal users will create by root user.
* System users-these users will create by installing any softwares. for eg. if we install Jenkins in system, then it will 
automatically create a user named with jenkins.

Note: binary files in both bin and sbin directories can accessible by root user. but the normal users and system users can
access the binary files which are in bin directory only.

*etc is the another directory in Linux. it contains all the configuration files shown below.
	sudoers
	sshd_config
	profile
	shadow
	group
	passwd
	motd-message of the day.
note: passwd and shadow directories contains the all user directories.
*lib is the another directory in linux. it contains library files.
*proc is also a directory in linux. in linux, for each task it is going to create a process id. those id's are going to 
store in this proc directory.
*cpuinfo is a directory in linux. it contains cpu information.
*meminfo is a directory. it contains memory information.
*opt is also a directory as program files in windows. each and every application or third party software which we install 
in linux server is going to store in "opt" directory.
*tmp is also a directory. which is accessible by every user. for eg. if any user wants to share the data with another user 
directly he can't access another user files.. so the user1 share the data to tmp directory and then the user2 share the data
from tmp directory.
*var is also a directory. system lock files are going to store in this var directory.
*dev is also a directory. we can attach n no. of devices like hard disks, printers etc., these connected devices information 
is going to store in "dev" directory.

Linux Commands:
---------------
cd, mkdir, rmdir, ls, sudo su -, (-v, -p, -l, -a, -lh)along with ls, tree, cd .., -lt, -ltr, pwd, uname, clear, exit,

*imp--> What is Inode?
	Inode is a datastructure, it can store the file/directory information(permissions, links, ownername, group name, size,
	timestamp). it doesn't contain file/directory name.

cd ~ --> go to home directory.
rmdir --> to remove single empty directory.
rm -rf --> to remove all non-empty directories 
rm -f --> to remove files.
mkdir --> to create directory/file.
ls --> to list out the no. of directories/files.
sudo su - --> to move to root user.
-v --> display the msg.
-p --> represents parent root.
-l --> long listing.
-a --> all.
-m --> mode of the directory.
-lh --> human readable format.
tree --> displays the files or directories info in tree structure.
cd .. --> moves to the back directory.
-lt --> displays the data in order with respect to the accessed timing.
-ltr --> reverse order for -lt.
pwd --> prints working directory name.
uname --> displays the user name.
clear --> clears the screen.
exit --> exit from the current user.
touch --> creates the file with zero bytes.
yum --> to install packages.
find --> to search the directories.
	e.g, find . -type f --> to search all the files in current directory.
	     find . -type f -empty --> to search empty files in current directory.
	     find . -type d -empty --> to search empty directories in current directory.
umask --> umask value for root user is 0022.
	  umask value for normal user is 0002. 	to set the umask value or to know the umask value we will use this command.
*Base permissions for dir is 0777. to get default directory permissions of root user subtract the umask value from 0777.
*Base permissions for file is 0666. in the same way while subtracting the umask value of root/normal user from 0666, we will
get default file permissions.
chmod --> to change the permissions of directory/file.
	chmod permissions directory/file name.
    eg.,chmod    544         DevOps
chown --> to change the owner/user for directory/file.
chgrp --> to change the group for directory/file.
note: only root user have permission to use chown and chgrp commands.
cp: it is used to copy file/directory from one place to another place.
mv: it is used to move file/directory from one place to another place. and also used to rename directory/file name..
file: it is used to know the file details.
wc: word count
ln: it is used to create link between files.
